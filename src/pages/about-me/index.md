## The Skinny...

I'm a web developer, tech speaker from Danang, Vietnam ðŸ‡»ðŸ‡³. I'm 33 years old and I've been making websites for about 13 years.

I use HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Though constantly changing, my focus right now is React.js, Node, Express, Gatsby, Next.js. Recently I'm working with a new project [Shopware](https://www.shopware.com/en/) - stack is PHP/Symfony, Vue.js, Bootstrap4.

My friends and me run a local community for tech called [Google Developer Group Mien Trung aka "GDG Mien Trung"](https://gdgmientrung.com/en/). Together we bring the latest technologies from Google and other componies on the world to our beloved community. We hope this little effect can help our next developer generations becomming better and catchup with the world standard.
